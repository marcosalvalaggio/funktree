# FunkTree

The **FunkTree** plugin simplifies navigation through objects and key structures in files. It's self-contained, avoiding external dependencies or reliance on other plugins. 

Currently, FunkTree works exclusively with **Python** files, enabling users to navigate among classes, methods, and functions within the open file.

## Installation 

The [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) plugin manager is the only installation method that has been tested. However, theoretically, you can install **FunkTree** using your preferred package manager.

 ```lua
 use("marcosalvalaggio/funktree")
 ```
