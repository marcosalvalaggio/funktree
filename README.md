## FunkTree

The FunkTree plugin simplifies navigation through objects and key structures in files. It's self-contained, avoiding external dependencies or reliance on other plugins. 

Currently, FunkTree works exclusively with Python files, enabling users to navigate among classes, methods, and functions within the open file.
